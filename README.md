This is the improved platform for the schnapsen card game.



To get started, and be able to edit the code run:

```sh
pip install -e .
```

To run the tests, run:

```sh
pip install -e '.[test]'

pytest ./tests
```
If above doesn't work, try deactivating your python and activating again (or just turn off and back on your console).

To test run the GUI, run:
```sh
python executables/server.py
```

You will find bot examples in the src/schnapsen/bots folder and executable examples in the executables folder.
